# Project Title:
IT_EXPENDITURE_DASHBOARD_POWER-BI


# Description
This project presents an interactive IT Expenditure Dashboard built using Power BI. The dashboard delivers a comprehensive view of an organisation’s IT budget, actuals, forecast, and plan — making it easier for finance and IT leadership to monitor cost drivers, variances and trends.  


# Key Insights:
•	Total Actual: 555.7 M <br />
•	Total Forecast: 890.5 M <br />
•	Plan vs Actual Variance: 9.9 M <br />
•	Plan vs Forecast Variance: 0.62 <br />
•	Plan vs Forecast Variance %: 0.01 % <br />


# Dashboard Highlights:
•	Time trend visualisation of “Total Actual”, “Total Forecast” and “Sum of Plan” by month, enabling you to spot seasonality or budget‐drift over time. <br />
•	Breakdown by business area and IT area, letting you drill into which divisions (e.g., Distribution, Infrastructure, Manufacturing, Office & Admin, R&D; IT Support, Enablement, Functional, Governance) are driving cost variances. <br />
•	Cost‐element analysis (e.g., Labour, Depreciation, Hardware, Other) via pie & bar charts, providing visibility of cost composition and where the bulk of expenditure lies. <br />
•	Variance heat-map or table by country, showing where forecast/plan deviations are highest—facilitating geo-specific insights and actions. <br />
•	Fully interactive filters/slicers for business area, IT area, month, etc.—so stakeholders can explore from aggregate to detailed levels. <br />


# Tools & Tech:
•	Power BI Desktop – for data modelling, DAX measures, and dashboard design <br />
•	Data source(s) – structured import of actuals, forecast, and plan data; prepared (cleaned, transformed) via Excel or Power Query <br />
•	Use of DAX to calculate variances, % variances, running totals, etc. <br />


# Why it matters:
## By comparing actual spend vs planned and forecasted spend, this dashboard empowers organisations to:
•	Monitor IT budget health in near-real‐time <br />
•	Identify cost overruns or under-spending early <br />
•	Allocate resources more effectively and proactively <br />
•	Support decision-making at finance and IT leadership levels <br />


# Dataset Source:
The dashboard uses consolidated data for actuals, forecast and plan by cost-centre, cost-element, business/IT area and geography. Data was cleaned and structured (e.g., unified date dimension, cost-category mapping) before being loaded into Power BI.
