# Project Title:
IT_EXPENDITURE_DASHBOARD_POWER_BI


# Description
This project presents an interactive IT Expenditure Dashboard built using Power BI. The dashboard delivers a comprehensive view of an organisation’s IT budget, actuals, forecast, and plan — making it easier for finance and IT leadership to monitor cost drivers, variances and trends.  


# Objectives
•	To track total IT spending and compare it with forecasted budgets. <br />
•	To identify variances between planned and actual expenditures across regions and business units. <br />
•	To analyze costs by IT area, business area, and cost element for better financial control. <br />
•	To support data-driven budgeting and cost optimization decisions. <br />


# Key Metrics & KPIs
•	Total Actual: 555.7M <br />
•	Total Forecast: 890.5M <br />
•	Plan vs Actual Variance: 344.7M <br />
•	Plan vs Forecast Variance %: 0.62 <br />
•	Plan vs Actual Variance %: 0.01 <br />


# Dashboard Insights
## Total Actual vs Forecast by Month: 
Shows how spending trends align with the budget throughout the year. <br />
## Variance by Business Area: 
Highlights which departments (Infrastructure, Manufacturing, R&D, etc.) deviate most from the plan. <br />
## Plan vs Actual Variance by Country: 
Displays top regions contributing to expenditure variances. <br />
## Cost Element Analysis: 
Breaks down spending into categories such as Labor, Regular Salary, Professional Services, etc. <br />
## IT Area Performance: 
Compares IT Support, Enablement, Functional, and Governance spending. <br />


# Tools & Technologies Used
•	Microsoft Power BI – Dashboard development & data visualization <br />
•	Excel / CSV Dataset – Data source <br />
•	Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation <br />
•	DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures & variance metrics <br />


# Key Features
•	Interactive filters for Business Area, IT Area, and Month <br />
•	Clear variance visualization with color-coded heatmaps <br />
•	Combined analysis of Total Actual, Forecast, and Plan values <br />
•	Detailed cost breakdown for transparency and accuracy <br />


# Key Learnings
•	Developed strong understanding of financial data visualization and variance analysis. <br />
•	Learned to create hierarchical views for different organizational levels (BU, IT area, Country). <br />
•	Gained experience in using Power BI DAX formulas for variance percentage calculations. <br />
